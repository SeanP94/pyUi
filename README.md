# pyUi

---

This is a for fun-ish project, where I just want to explore building my own
GUI.

The initial goal is to build enough tools for:
- A menu system
- Drawing a grid
- - Interacting with said grid
  
And Finally,
An initial project outcome should be:
- A menu for starting Project
- Running an A* path finder from one part of the map to the other.
- Use different colored blocks on grid as walls, terrain, water etc
- Let the A* attempt to get to the user at the optimal route (IE go around walls, through terrain over water...)

The way I can achieve this is just getting comfortable again with pygame itself. As I'm playing around with it, I plan on moduleizing the code and
saving it for later use so that the code is easily reusable by me.

This kind of project will be great for GUI work, OOP programming, A* AI for games that I can use later. And building a general good base foundation for building a simple-ish RPG I would EVENTUALLY like to make.  

pyUi will be the library I plan on building out long term to make my life easier for other possible GUI projects in the future, for now it's a playground for me to have fun.

- I'm not sure of the legality of me giving out this .ttf, so please just download it, unzip it and place it in the objs folder :)
- - I'll try and create a systems folder (soon) so that I can have this set and it can just be easy to change it to sans serif or somethin.
